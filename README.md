Project: AI-Based Traffic Signal Optimization 
Metaheuristic Algorithms used: Sea Horse Optimizer (SHO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) 
Simulated on: SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility)

Objective:
Optimize traffic light timings to reduce average vehicle waiting time using AI algorithms, at a 4-way traffic intersection.

Tools & Technologies: 
Python 3.9.21
SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility)
SHO (Sea Horse Optimizer)
GA (Genetic Algorithm)

Results:
Both algorithms reduced vehicle wait times when compared to fixed-time traffic control.
However, both of them converged to a similar solution (green time durations), and provided a similar fitness value.
